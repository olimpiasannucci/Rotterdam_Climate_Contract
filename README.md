# Rotterdam_Climate_Contract

Project developed while attending the course "Smart Citites and Climate Neutrality". A CLimate City Contract is a a governance innovation tool to help cities collaboratively address their barriers to reaching climate neutrality by 2030. In this case the focus was the city of Rotterdam, the second largest city and municipality in the Netherlands.  

The CCC is the documented result of an iterative co-creation process. The process foresees the engagement by the city and involves multiple stakeholders at various governance levels, as well as the wider ecosystem of private and civic stakeholders. Different and innovative tools and solutions have been identified to achieve 2030 climate neutrality, and the ways and means to implement them.
